# 🛡️ About Me  

## 🕵️‍♂️ How It All Started...  
It all began when I was in **10th grade**, innocently scrolling through **Facebook**, when a friend confidently told me:  

> *"I can hack into your account without your password!"*  

Being the ever curious person I am, I **challenged** him. And to my absolute **horror (and amazement)**, he actually **did it**! That moment sparked my **obsession with cybersecurity**.  

I started like any newbie **googling "how to hack Facebook" (don't judge, we've all been there 😆)**. That led me down a rabbit hole of **phishing, OSINT, social engineering, bug bounties, and penetration testing**. Fast forward to today, and here I am, living the cybersecurity dream, but this time, on the **right side** of the game. 😎
