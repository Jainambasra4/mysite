You know itâ€™s a solid night when one handshake turns into ten conversations that could launch the next big thing.

When you find yourself in a room where **[@Rinki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rinkisethi/)** and **[@Lucas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lwmoody/)** are holding court, you know youâ€™ve hit the jackpot.

From *stealth-mode whispers* to *bold visions* â€” and maybe a few **karaoke-level laughs** â€” this night in **#NewYork** is definitely staying in my memory.

Iâ€™m grateful for the **genuine energy**, **curiosity**, and **controlled chaos** that brought everyone together. 

If you were in the room, you know exactly what I mean. ðŸ˜„
