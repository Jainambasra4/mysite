## 🚀 The Cybersecurity Journey  

Back in the day, **I had no idea that a simple curiosity about hacking would turn into a full-fledged career.** 🤯 It all started when a friend challenged me in **10th grade**, claiming he could hack my **Facebook account** (with my consent, of course!).  

💡 To my shock, **he actually did it!** That moment sparked my **deep curiosity for cybersecurity.** From Googling *"how to hack social media accounts"* (yes, we all started somewhere!) to learning about **phishing, OSINT, and social engineering,** I was hooked.  

Fast forward a few years, and I found myself **pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity at UMBC**, navigating a new country, new culture, and an ever-evolving cyber landscape.
